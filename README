Nothing to see here, please move along.

Some of my snippet collections, exported from Eclipse, collected and accidentally deleted over the years.

I still don't know a good way to manage code-snippets on Eclipse. Never used the feature to its fullest potential.

Maybe github.com is the resolution to this problem, and to the syncing problem.
